If you want to use this RateMyBeer.py
make sure you installed pymysql, json, flask related packages with pip

this backend service will run on http://localhost:8090/
so make sure the 8090 port is available

download the data from link provided by Xintong, it's a cvs file and you should import them into
database: dsci551 table:beer
I used DataGrip from JetBrains, you may use other database management software like navicat, they all support such fuction
user: root and password should be you own password, you may make little modification there

and I tested all 4 functions with postman, they all worked well for me, so Let me know if there's a problem
